```

Run this in Bash in the homework folder:

This code removes space in file name and replaces it with an underscore:

for file in *\ *; do
  mv "$file" "${file// /_}"
done

This code extracts the last names from the directory names:

$ ls | cut -d _ -f 2 > names.txt

This code renames the folders with the last names from the txt file:

 ls  | paste - names.txt   | awk 'NF == 2 { print "mv ", $1, $2 } ' | bash
